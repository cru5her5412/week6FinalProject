# Image gallery using my own api

- What requirements did you achieve?
  All requirements met, with some stretch goals achieved (and my own personal challenge to host my own api)
- Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
  Could have improved the UI a bit for another stretch goal
- If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
  I do not enjoy making UIs for apps, I prefer the backend

- Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
  Is the way i handled being able to select a specific image accessible, would a screenreader still read the alt of an image if it was inside a button, and would it read it when the image was selected?
- What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
  Looked at the Express api documentation, some forums on render server issues, and a geeksforgeeks page on how to host files on an express server
- What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
  Had an issue with hosting the images where my render deployment never finished deploying correctly, searched around on forums and found a suggestion to add a PORT environment variable to the server that matches the one i was using, this fixed the issue completely
- What went really well and what could have gone better?
  MVP was created very quickly. I should've looked into render forums sooner, as I tried other things within the app to no avail, when the issue was somewhat clearly to do with render itself.
